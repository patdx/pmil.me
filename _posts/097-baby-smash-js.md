## About

This is an application to entertain babies.

You can throw letters around the screen and they will be read out loud by your
computer's speech synthesizer (results may vary depending on your browser and
OS).

I created it to entertain my daughter and also study about 3D rendering, PWAs,
etc.

Please find more info on Github.
