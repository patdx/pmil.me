## About

This is an application to entertain babies.

Inspired by the classics:

- [Baby Smash](https://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/)
- [AlphaBaby](http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/)

You can throw letters around the screen and they will be read out loud by your
computer's speech synthesizer (results may vary depending on your browser and
OS).

I created it to entertain my daughter and also study about 3D rendering, PWAs,
etc.

Please find more info on Github.
