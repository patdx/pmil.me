## About

This is a project to check train delay times on the JR system.

Built using React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and other technologies.

The accessed API is undocumented, and unfortunately no longer seems to function
correctly.

Due to API limitations, this application can show delay times and the train's
current location, but scheduled arrival time data is unavailable.
