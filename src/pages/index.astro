          Hello! My name is Patrick Miller. I have been working as a full-stack
          software engineer in Osaka, Japan for several years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work on web and hybrid mobile applications using Node, Angular,
          Ionic, Electron, React, etc. I also like to develop internal tools and
          systems to help my fellow project members work efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>I have past experience in QA, IT and mechanical engineering.</p>
        <p>
          Here are some various hobby projects that might be interesting. Feel
          free to contact me! Thank you.
